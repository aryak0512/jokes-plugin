# ShitJokes Plugin for IntelliJ

Today I developed & contributed a custom plugin called "ShitJokes" for the popular Jetbrains IDE - IntelliJ. This fun plugin, written in Kotlin tells you a joke every time you ask it to - a breather between hours of debugging:)

Here is the YouTube preview for it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGgYq8dYdoM

IntelliJ Marketplace : https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26812-shitjokes

If you're a IntelliJ user, it's available in the IDE's Plugin Hub. Do try it out & let me know your thoughts!
